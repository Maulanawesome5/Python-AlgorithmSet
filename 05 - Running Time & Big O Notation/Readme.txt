# Big O Notation
Big O Notation tells you how fast an algorithm is.
For example, suppose you have a list of size n.
Simple Search needs to check each element, so it will take n operations.
The run time in Big O Notation is O(n).
Big O doesn't tell you the speed in seconds. Big O Notation lets you compare
the number of operations. It tells you how fast the algorithms grow.

Binary Search needs log n operations to check a list of size n.
What's the running time in Big O notation? It's O(log n)
This tells you the number of operations an algorithm will make.
It's called Big O Notation because you put a "big O" in front of the number
of operations (it sounds like a joke, but it's true).
